### code 3-1
-Init Code for XORLearning Example 
-Now that the ground truth has been altered for the training example 
 to range from 0.0 to 1.0 because, as previously stated, we have selected the logistic sigmoid function as our 
 activation function for the output neuron, unlike the perceptron, which had an output of -1.0 our neuron's output does not go to -1.0.

### code 3-2
 -Variables Needed to Track State of Neurons
 -Declare variables to hold the state of our three
  neurons
 -These are all the state variables that we need for each neuron for both the
  forward pass and the backward pass: weights (n_w), output (n_y),3 and
  error term (n_error). We arbitrarily initialize the input weights to random
  numbers between -1.0 and 1.0, and we set the bias weights to 0.0.
### code 3-3
-Helper Functions for Backpropagation
